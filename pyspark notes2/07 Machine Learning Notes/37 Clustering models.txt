Clustering Models:

Clustering: Clustering is the process of grouping objects based on their similarities.

here we can create 'n' groups  called 'n' clusters.

Clustering models comes under unsupervised learning.

un-supervised learning : without label, we train the model
                         means by using only i/p features,we train the model

ex:

k-means
k-median

These are used to identify hidden behavioral patterns within the data

-here everything is i/p variable--->there is no target variable.

ex: Take data of 2 variables of a person

Age  income
26    30k
45    75k
23    85k
.
.
.
.
In this way,if 1000recs are given,just by seeing this we cannot identify how many behaviors are 
there

Data clustering Algorithms will help in identifying the hidden behaviours

i.e the no of clusters i.e the similar behaviors


in the fig.

1st person---->age 25 ------>income-->30
on this what is ur assumption ----->less age 
                                    less income

next person ----->age high----->income also high
"    "      ----->age less --->income high
"    "      ----->age high --->less income


here 4 different behaviors are there

1)Less age less income
2)less age high income
3)high age high income
4)High age less income

Assume given data has 1000 records--->by seeing the data,we wont understand the behavior

here we are not performing, on their age predict income?

ex: 1000 people are loan customers

The Bank is asking to identify the behaviour within the given customers;


-in these 1000records--->we see some outliers

I make into 4 clusters
cluster1---->350---->340 people paid the loans
                      10 people not paid the loans

cluster2---->150---->20people notpaid the loans
cluster3---->200---->70 not paid the loans
cluster4---->300----->150 not paid the loans

Bow Banker comes and applies labels

cluster1----->non-risk
cluster2----->non-risk
cluster3----->risk
cluster4----->high risk

Ravi 25age 32k as income----cluster3------>high risk
Sony 23age 70k ------------- cluster1------>high age high income
