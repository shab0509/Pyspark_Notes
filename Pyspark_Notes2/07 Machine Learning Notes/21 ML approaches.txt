Machine Learning follows 2 types of Approaches:

1)Supervised Learning : here prediction based on i/p variable and response variable
2)unsupervised Learning : here prediction based on only i/p variable

1)Supervised Learning :  Here i/p data should contain both i/p variables and Response variables
                         based on i/p data patterns and based on response variables models
                         will predict and estimate.This approach is called as supervised learning

temp sales
25    27k
27    29k
29    31k
31    33k
33    35k
10    15k
12   ------?--16k


here temp--->i/p variable
     sales-->o/p variable (or) Target variable (or) Response variable
In ML Terminology----->i/p variables are called as features
                       o/p varible is called as Label

Note: we can have multiple i/p variables

Ex:
   Titaninc
   Name  age class       status
   Ajay  25   I          survived
   Rahul 50   II         Dead
    -    -     -           -

here Name,age,class are i/p variables(Features)
     status is          o/p variables(LAbel)

predict for JAmes----?
    JAmes  20  I         ?

ex:3 Bank loan example

Features-------->Name,age,income,company,exp,designation
Label----------->Approve/rejected

Name AGe income desig  status
Ajay 40  70k    Teacher Approved
Rahul 20  -     student rejected

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
un-supervised learning: based on i/p variable we performing prediction
                        here target variable is not involved
